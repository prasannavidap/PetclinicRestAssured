pre-requisites - download code and do setup from  https://github.com/prasannavidap/PetclinicRestAssured/tree/master


You will need Lombok plug-in installed and configured on Eclipse /IntelliJ

I'm using Json2POJO Plugin in intelliJ to auto-generate classes from JSON request/response. 

There must either be inbuilt support or similar Plugin for Eclipse.

Other dependencies like Gradle should get auto-installed
